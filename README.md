## ETSI Traffic: models the burstyness of traffic

## Packet service session: 
1. consists of packet calls (number of packet calls is geometric)
2. inter-session time is exponential

## Packet call:
1. consists of packets (number of packets is geometric)
2. inter-call time (reading time) is exponential

## Packet:
1. packet inter-arrival time is exponential
